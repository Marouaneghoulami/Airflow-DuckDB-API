# (QuickStart) Data Engineering Project

This is a straightforward Data Engineering project designed to help you get started with essential skills and tools. It uses Python to interact with an API, retrieve data, and store it in a database, with Airflow managing the data pipeline. This foundational setup allows you to practice basic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes without additional complexities.

### Project Details
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Sources**: Mock API (Mockaroo)
- **Storage**: DuckDB
- **Pipeline Orchestration**: Airflow
- **GenAI Assistant**: ChatGPT

### Tutorial & Demo
- **Live Coding & Building**: [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmrSw-UzBDg)  
  In this video, explore the project setup, code structure, and a demonstration of data flowing from the API to DuckDB.

This project is ideal for beginners, introducing foundational data engineering concepts and tools commonly used in the field.
